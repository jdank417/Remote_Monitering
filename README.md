# Remote System Monitoring
This repository provides a solution for remotely monitoring system information using a combination of Python, Flask, and PowerShell. The project includes a Flask web application that displays real-time system metrics, which are gathered by executing a PowerShell script that connects to a remote machine.

## Project Structure
#### app.py: 
The main Flask application that reads data from a JSON file and displays it on a web page. It also allows manual refreshing of the data by re-running the PowerShell script.
#### remote_monitor_json.ps1: 
A PowerShell script that connects to a remote machine using SSH and retrieves CPU, Memory, and Disk information, then stores it as a JSON file locally.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.12
Flask (pip install Flask)
PowerShell with plink installed for SSH connectivity
SSH access to the remote machine with valid credentials
A remote machine running a Linux-based operating system (for commands like top, free, and df)



## How It Works
#### Data Gathering: 
The PowerShell script (remote_monitor_json.ps1) connects to a remote Linux machine using SSH. It runs several commands to gather information about CPU, Memory, and Disk usage, and stores this data in a JSON file (RemoteSystemInfo.json).

#### Data Display: 
The Flask application (app.py) reads the JSON file and renders the data on a web page using an HTML template (index.html).

#### Manual Refresh: 
Users can trigger the PowerShell script manually through the Refresh button on the web page. This updates the JSON file and displays the latest information.

## File Descriptions
#### app.py:
Contains the Flask web application that serves the system information.
Provides a /refresh route to execute the PowerShell script and refresh the data.

#### remote_monitor_json.ps1:
Retrieves CPU, Memory, and Disk information from a remote Linux machine using SSH.
Filters unwanted messages and writes the results to RemoteSystemInfo.json as a JSON object.

#### RemoteSystemInfo.json:
The JSON file where the system information is stored. It is generated and updated by the PowerShell script.

## Interpreting CPU ussage

 - Example output: %Cpu(s): 22.2 us, 11.1 sy, 0.0 ni, 66.7 id, 0.0 wa, 0.0 hi, 0.0 si, 0.0 st

 - This shows you the distribution of how your CPU's time is being used. Here’s a breakdown of each component:

   **us (User space): 22.2%**
   This indicates that 22.2% of the CPU time is being used by user-space processes, such as applications or scripts that you run.
   
   **sy (System): 11.1%**
   This shows that 11.1% of the CPU time is being used by the system/kernel processes. These are tasks that handle system-level operations, such as device drivers and other OS functions.
   
   **ni (Nice): 0.0%**
   The "nice" value refers to the amount of CPU time being used by processes that have been given a positive or negative priority (nice value). In your case, no CPU time is being consumed by processes with a non-standard priority, so it's 0.0%.
   
   **id (Idle): 66.7%**
   This value represents how much of the CPU time is idle. It means that 66.7% of the CPU is not doing any work and is essentially waiting for tasks.
   
   **wa (IO Wait): 0.0%**
   This indicates that no time is being spent waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading or writing to disk).
   
   **hi (Hardware Interrupts): 0.0%**
   No CPU time is being spent handling hardware interrupts, which are signals sent by hardware devices (like a keyboard or network adapter) indicating they need the CPU's attention.
   
   **si (Software Interrupts): 0.0%**
   No time is being used for handling software interrupts, which are similar to hardware interrupts but are generated by software processes.
   
   **st (Steal): 0.0%**
   "Steal" time represents the amount of CPU time stolen from the virtual machine (if you're running one) by the hypervisor for other tasks. Since it’s 0.0%, no CPU time is being stolen for other virtual machines.
