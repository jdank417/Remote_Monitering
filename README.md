# Remote System Information Script

This PowerShell script connects to a remote Linux machine using SSH to retrieve and log system information (CPU, memory, and disk usage) into a local file on the desktop. The results are appended to a text file named `RemoteSystemInfo.txt` with each execution.

## Features
- Retrieves CPU usage using the `top` command.
- Retrieves memory usage using the `free` command.
- Retrieves disk usage using the `df` command.
- Filters out unwanted messages from the SSH output.
- Appends the results to a text file with a timestamp for each execution.
- Automatically presses "Enter" after displaying each result to ensure script progression.

## Requirements
- PowerShell 5.0 or higher.
- **plink** (part of PuTTY) must be installed and accessible from the command line.
- Access to the remote Linux machine with valid SSH credentials.
- Basic knowledge of PowerShell and Windows environment variables.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure that `plink.exe` is installed and accessible via the command line.
   - You can download PuTTY from [here](https://www.putty.org/).
   - Add `plink.exe` to your system's PATH.
   
2. Modify the script to include your remote machine's IP, username, and password. These are defined in the following variables at the start of the script:
   ```PowerShell
   $ipAddress = IP_OF_YOUR_SYSTEM
   $user = USER_OF_YOUR_SYSTEM
   $password = PASS_OF_YOUR_SYSTEM

  ## Execution
  1. This script will populate a text file called "RemoteSystemInfo.txt" on your desktop with the output.


## Interpreting CPU ussage

1. Example output: %Cpu(s): 22.2 us, 11.1 sy, 0.0 ni, 66.7 id, 0.0 wa, 0.0 hi, 0.0 si, 0.0 st

2. this shows you the distribution of how your CPU's time is being used. Here’s a breakdown of each component:

   **us (User space): 22.2%**
   This indicates that 22.2% of the CPU time is being used by user-space processes, such as applications or scripts that you run.
   
   **sy (System): 11.1%**
   This shows that 11.1% of the CPU time is being used by the system/kernel processes. These are tasks that handle system-level operations, such as device drivers and other OS functions.
   
   **ni (Nice): 0.0%**
   The "nice" value refers to the amount of CPU time being used by processes that have been given a positive or negative priority (nice value). In your case, no CPU time is being consumed by processes with a non-standard priority, so it's 0.0%.
   
   **id (Idle): 66.7%**
   This value represents how much of the CPU time is idle. It means that 66.7% of the CPU is not doing any work and is essentially waiting for tasks.
   
   **wa (IO Wait): 0.0%**
   This indicates that no time is being spent waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading or writing to disk).
   
   **hi (Hardware Interrupts): 0.0%**
   No CPU time is being spent handling hardware interrupts, which are signals sent by hardware devices (like a keyboard or network adapter) indicating they need the CPU's attention.
   
   **si (Software Interrupts): 0.0%**
   No time is being used for handling software interrupts, which are similar to hardware interrupts but are generated by software processes.
   
   **st (Steal): 0.0%**
   "Steal" time represents the amount of CPU time stolen from the virtual machine (if you're running one) by the hypervisor for other tasks. Since it’s 0.0%, no CPU time is being stolen for other virtual machines.
